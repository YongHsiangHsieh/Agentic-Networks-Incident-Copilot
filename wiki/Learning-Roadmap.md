# Learning Roadmap

Curated path distilled from `START_HERE.md` and `LEARNING_ROADMAP.md`.

## 90-Minute Speed Run
- README overview (10m)
- Architecture (30m): [Architecture](Architecture.md)
- Code Walkthrough (30m): [Code Walkthrough](Code-Walkthrough.md)
- Demo with Claude (20m): [MCP Setup](MCP-Setup.md)

## 4-Hour Comprehensive Path
1. Start here (20m): [README](../README.md), this Roadmap
2. Architecture (60-90m): [Architecture](Architecture.md)
3. Code details (60m): [Code Walkthrough](Code-Walkthrough.md)
4. Workflows (30m): [LangGraph Workflow](LangGraph-Workflow.md)
5. Interfaces (30m): [API Reference](API-Reference.md), [MCP Tools](MCP-Tools.md)
6. Hands-on (30m): [Testing & Demo](Testing-and-Demo.md)

## Goals & Outcomes
- Understand WHY (design decisions and trade-offs)
- Understand HOW (code, prompts, validation)
- Operate (run API, run MCP servers, test flows)
- Extend (add playbooks, tweak scoring, adjust prompts)

## Tips
- Read actively (ask why each choice exists)
- Keep code open while reading
- Modify a prompt and observe behavior
- Add a playbook and see it ranked
