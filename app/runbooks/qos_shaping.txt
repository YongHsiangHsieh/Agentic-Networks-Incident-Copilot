QoS Traffic Shaping Runbook

Overview:
Quality of Service (QoS) traffic shaping manages bandwidth allocation across
different traffic classes to prioritize latency-sensitive flows.

QoS Shaping Strategy:
The qos_shaping approach throttles bulk or background traffic to free up bandwidth
for priority applications. This is effective when mixed traffic types compete for
limited capacity.

Best used when:
- Traffic analysis shows bulk/background flows consuming capacity
- Need to protect latency-sensitive applications
- Medium risk tolerance acceptable

Implementation steps:
1. Classify traffic into priority classes
2. Define shaping rates per class
3. Apply policies to congested interfaces
4. Monitor queue depths and drops
5. Fine-tune throttle percentages

Typical configurations:
- Throttle bulk traffic by 15-25%
- Prioritize real-time and interactive flows
- Set minimum bandwidth guarantees

Expected outcomes:
- Latency reduction: 20-40%
- Loss reduction for priority traffic: 40-60%
- Time to effect: 5-8 minutes
- May increase latency for throttled traffic classes
