Network Congestion Remediation Runbook

Overview:
This runbook covers standard procedures for resolving network congestion incidents
affecting critical paths with elevated latency and packet loss.

Partial Offload Strategy:
When congestion is detected on a primary path, partial_offload redirects a percentage
of traffic to alternate routes. This reduces load on the congested segment while
maintaining service continuity. Typical offload percentages range from 30-50%.

Best used when:
- Alternate paths have available capacity
- Primary path shows utilization > 85%
- Low risk tolerance for service disruption

Implementation steps:
1. Verify alternate path capacity and health
2. Calculate traffic split ratios
3. Update routing weights or BGP policies
4. Monitor for 5-10 minutes
5. Adjust offload percentage if needed

Expected outcomes:
- Latency reduction: 30-60%
- Loss reduction: 50-80%
- Time to effect: 3-5 minutes
