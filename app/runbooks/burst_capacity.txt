Burst Capacity Provisioning Runbook

Overview:
Burst capacity involves temporarily increasing bandwidth on a network segment
by provisioning additional capacity from the service provider.

Burst Capacity Strategy:
The burst_capacity option requests on-demand bandwidth increases to resolve
congestion. This is the most effective but costly solution for capacity issues.

Best used when:
- Organic traffic growth exceeds baseline capacity
- Other remediation options insufficient
- Budget available for emergency capacity
- Provider supports dynamic bandwidth scaling

Implementation steps:
1. Calculate required additional capacity (typically 5-20 Gbps)
2. Submit burst request to provider API
3. Wait for provisioning (2-4 minutes typically)
4. Verify increased bandwidth available
5. Update network monitoring thresholds

Cost considerations:
- Typical cost: €10-20 per Gbps per hour
- Bill in minimum 1-hour increments
- Automatic scaling policies may help optimize costs
- Compare to SLA penalty costs before approving

Expected outcomes:
- Latency reduction: 70-90% (restore to baseline)
- Loss reduction: 80-95%
- Time to effect: 4-6 minutes
- Immediate relief for capacity constraints

Rollback procedure:
- Monitor for sustained improvement (15-30 minutes)
- Gradually reduce burst capacity if organic load decreases
- Return to baseline capacity allocation
